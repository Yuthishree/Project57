<p >Reading develops our brains and gives us the ability to understand life in a much better fashion. When you read a lot, you learn new words all the time.Not sure how many readers will agree but I firmly believe books can go more in-depth than a movie can.
                  I like reading because it gets my imagination going in the morning. And it's really fun!  I love reading because every book unleashes a new adventure!</p>
